# fitnessFlexPlanner

Calorie Counting CRUD App! As well as a Meal Planning application.

# Description of Project:

This application is a fitness application. Users should be able to log in and scroll through pages,
Homepage, Calorie Page, and Meal Planning page. The homepage is supposed to display a graph and realistically that graph would change every week they log on... along with pulling up new recipes. They should be able to click on those recipes which would take them to the meal panning page. I bit off more than I could chew with the meal planner portion of the final. That page is supposed to show recipes up that they can save down or delete. They should also be able to search something specific and pull it up but sadly did not get it working. I cut that page out completely. The calorie count page is my working page where they can read and write to the database. Users should be able to log their calories and what they have eaten. Also, delete and edit them as well. My homepage I kept for show but I just made it a static design. All icons were pulled from flaticon!

# Issues in Styling:

- I got certain items on my pages to be responsive but it messes with my buttons, I'm not sure how to fix it.
- My nav bar isn't responsive, I noticed while coding out the design this navigation was not the best to do. I also had trouble targeting the text in my nav to make it look more centered.
- My logout link, the cursor will not display for some reason.
- The buttons in my forms also wouldn't center right.
- Lastly, images I couldn't resize my tables delete and edit button anymore.

# Proposed for Later:

A fitness portion I wanted to do later, I also need to do the meal planning section later. I'd really like to get that working!
